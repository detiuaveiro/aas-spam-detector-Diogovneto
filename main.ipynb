    "The dataset is different from the toy one used in the class, instead the work will be done on the Enron SPAM dataset. The Enron-Spam dataset is a fantastic ressource collected by V. Metsis, I. Androutsopoulos and G. Paliouras and described in their publication [\"Spam Filtering with Naive Bayes - Which Naive Bayes?\"](https://nes.aueb.gr/ipl/nlp/pubs/ceas2006_paper.pdf). The dataset contains a total of 17.171 spam and 16.545 non-spam (\"ham\") e-mail messages (33.716 e-mails total). The original dataset and documentation can be found [here](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/readme.txt)."
